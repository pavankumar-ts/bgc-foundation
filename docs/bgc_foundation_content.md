## Background - Rural Healthcare Crisis in India

### The Healthcare Challenge
Rural communities in India suffer from a significant lack of access to healthcare, resulting in:
- High rates of maternal & infant mortality
- Malnutrition and delayed diagnosis
- Low life expectancy and vaccination rates
- Strong economic burden on families
- 90% of population not covered by insurance
- Costs paid out of pocket or through loans
- Public spending below global average

### Professional Shortage in Rural Healthcare
**Primary Health Centers Vacancies:**
- **40%** without a lab technician
- **22%** without a pharmacist  
- **10%** without a doctor

**Community Health Centers Critical Gaps:**
- Surgeons, Gynecologists, Pediatricians, and Physicians positions largely vacant
- Red indicates vacancies, green indicates filled positions across rural health infrastructure

### Emerging Health Issues in Rural India
- Infectious diseases and malnutrition
- Poor maternal healthcare
- Rising non-communicable diseases
- **Increase in digestive health issues** including liver disease, IBD, and cancers
- Mental health issues
- Poor sanitation and unsafe drinking water

### Main Challenges
- **Geographical issues**: Remote locations difficult to access
- **Infrastructure availability**: Limited healthcare facilities
- **Healthcare workforce shortage**: Lack of specialists
- **Healthcare awareness & education**: Limited health literacy
- **Socioeconomic status**: Poverty preventing healthcare access

- **No easy access** to gastroenterologists and superspecialists

- **Significant nutrition problems** affecting both children & adults
- **3 out of 10 people** now suffer from digestive health issues that affect their overall health
